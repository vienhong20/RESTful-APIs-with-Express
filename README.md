# RESTful-APIs-with-Express
- REST defines a set of conventions for creating HTTP services: 
- POST: to create a resource
- PUT: to update it
- GET: to read it
- DELETE: to delete it

- Express is a simple, minimalistic and lightweight framework for building web
servers.

- We can use environment variables to store various settings for an application. To read an environment variable, we use process.env.

- You should never trust data sent by the client. Always validate! Use Joi package to perform input validation.

- Using Postman for interacting with HTTP APIs
